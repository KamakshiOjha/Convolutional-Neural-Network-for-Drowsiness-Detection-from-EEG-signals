# Convolutional Neural Network for Drowsiness Detection from EEG signals ðŸš€

Drowsiness is an intermediate state between sleepiness and awakening. It reduces a personâ€™s attention and vigilance towards the tasks he or she is performing. Drowsiness can prove harmful in driving situations, where the driverâ€™s loss of attention can cause road accidents resulting in serious injuries and deaths.

Challenges in Drowsiness Detection from EEG signals: Scarcity of labelled EEG datasets for drowsiness detection training. Striking a balance between removing unwanted signals in EEG data
and keeping important patterns that show when someone is sleepy.

About Model :

1.The model is made using CNN architecture with CBAM attention for enhanced spatial focus in drowsiness detection from EEG.

2.CBAM boosts spatial focus post-convolution, emphasizing vital spatial regions and channels while downplaying less significant ones, essential for precise drowsiness detection.

3.Flattened features go through dense layers for classifying EEG signals as drowsy or awake, yielding class probabilities with softmax activation for accurate classification.
